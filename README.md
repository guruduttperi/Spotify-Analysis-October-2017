Here, I have analyzed information from a statement from my music distributor. The statement is in the form of a comma-separated values file with columns - "Artist", "Country", "Release_Title", to say the least.

With the help of Python Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy and Pandas I have generated plots to analyze the trends.

The first plot I had made was "Release_Title" against "Gross_Revenue_in_USD".

Here, you can see which album was more popular and which was streamed the most and streamed the least.

The second plot is "Track_Title" against "Net_Revenue_in_USD",
![Tracks](Tracks.png)
Here, you can see which track was more popular and which was streamed the most and streamed the least.

Then, I did a Countplot for countries to find out in which country I had the most listeners.

Similarly, I did a Countplot for my artist profiles' popularity.

I had obtained results from another Countplot for various services - Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play Music.
